[Link to Story](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/peter.nguyen1212/viz/Challenge14_16645897345590/NYCCitiBikeAnalysis?publish=yes)

Purpose: The purpose of this analysis is to examine the success, utilization, and demographic of users who participate in the CitiBike program in New York City.
This analysis will cover trip duration, as well as likely usages in order to gauge if there is a market to be made for bike rental programs. Tableau stories were used to visualize all figures and combine multiple visualizations to make better inferences.

Results:

Utilization:
CitiBike is used all over New York City, with the exception of Jersey.  The majority of CitiBike Usage occurs in Manhatten around busy areas such as Midtown Manhatten, Soho, and Battery City. The Peak hours have local maxima of 8am and 5pm.

Most rides take place at 8am and 5pm on weekdays, and is otherwise evenly spread mid day on weekends from 9am to 7am.  The length of each ride has a statistical mode of 5 minutes, with the majority of rides being no longer than 20 minutes.

The majority of users are male subscribers.  Gender does not play a role in the length of time for each ride.

The distribution of usage throughout the week suggests that most users are subscribing to bicycles during the week for work day commute to 9am to 5pm shifts.  The majority are male. Female subscribers although fewer, mostly use it for the same purpose. Regular customers are fewer but utilize the bikes on every day of the week on a fairly constant basis with potential local maximas on the weekends.

Summary:
The CitiBike program may be an attractive business to investors.  The majority of users are committed to a regular subscription and utiliize the bikes on regular commute creating a dependancy based demand.  Unsubscried users also regularly use the bicycles and may represent tourists or non-locals, although the disribution of their usage is more uniform.  Although modelled in the module, the individual usages of each bike as well as the repair rate of each bike indicates that a need to repair occurs in certain areas of heavy utilization.  On site or nearby bike maintenance stations may reduce downtown in these areas, which are also candidates for increased bike supply.  

Although the focus of this analysis highlights the regular usage of the CitiBike program, it would be interesting to know about the extreme using other visualizations.  
Although there are very few, some bike rides exceed 20 minutes and may go on for a very long time. Instead of plotting the most typical bike utilization, we may choose to analyze the longest bike ride by sorting data by tripduration.  We may also choose to use that information to filter and figure out who these users are, if they are on a subscription model, as well as mapping to figure out where they are coming from.  

Most users are in the Manhatten area, little is known about the users on Long Island.  It would be interesting to create triplength and utilization data filtered specifically for long island.
